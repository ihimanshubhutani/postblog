**Dante 3 - This is it!**
=========================

**Just another medium clone built on top of ProseMirror's / TipTap**
--------------------------------------------------------------------

> Dante3 is a ProseMirror port ofÂ [Dante2 (Draftjs)Â ](https://github.com/michelson/Dante/tree/master/packages/dante2). This version is built on top ofÂ [TipTap's Prosemirror](https://www.tiptap.dev/)Â and reaches all Dante2's features with a shiny ultra mega super uber maintainable architecture.

See the demo at:Â [dante-editor.dev](https://www.dante-editor.dev/)

**Why rewrite a new version of Dante?**
---------------------------------------

The previous version (Dante2) was made on DraftJs, that's a facebook library to build WYSIWYG editor, I'd choose that technology because it implemented a very interesting data model and abstracted many parts of the heuristics implementation thatÂ [Dante1 (the previous version)](https://github.com/michelson/Dante/tree/master/packages/dante1-legacy)Â built as a naive implementation relying a lot on DOM manipulation, So Dante2 was great and is working on a ton of production websites. Sadly over the last years this library has not received much attention from maintainers. Among the ~700 unattended reported issues there are some that have become a deal breaker for me:

-   Bad mobile support.

-   ~1MB added to your bundle (immutablejs is heavy)

-   Not created for realtime collab.

**My bet, ProseMirror/TipTap**

After shopping many editors libraries, I mean after tried to implement Dante on almost all of themÂ **(Trix, Editorjs, Quilljs, Slate, Prosemirror)**Â I've choosen Prosemirror's **TipTap** library., I guess all editors libraries have their own flaws but after review it all TipTap is the best of it's class, very well designed/architectured, and I love the community around their ecosystem. So that's it.
